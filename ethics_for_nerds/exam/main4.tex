    P1:& Explainable high-stake autonomous decisions can be audited and improved. \\
    P2:& Explainable high-stake autonomous decisions have no significant drawbacks over unexplainable high-stake autonomous decisions. \\
    P3:& If \emph{explainable high-stake autonomous decisions can be audited and improved} and \emph{explainable high-stake autonomous decisions have no significant drawbacks over unexplainable high-stake autonomous decisions} then \emph{explainable high-stake autonomous decisions provide more utility for the society than unexplainable high-stake autonomous decisions.} \\
    P4:& If \emph{explainable high-stake autonomous decision provide more utility for the society than unexplainable high-stake autonomous decisions} then \emph{it would prima facie be beneficial if all high-stake autonomous decisions were explainable.} \\
    \hline
    C:& It would prima facie be beneficial if all high-stake autonomous decisions were explainable.

    The structure is:
	P1: $a$ \qquad
	P2: $b$ \qquad
	P3: $(a \wedge b) \rightarrow c$ \qquad
	P4: $c \rightarrow d$ \qquad
	C: $d$.
	
	The premises are not controversial and are charitably plausible.
	For decision-making, the premises in the argument would however need to be supported by evidence.
