# Heads and constituents
- __head__: most important word in the phrase
- - it's possible to substitute the whole phrase with the head
- - often require dependents to agree grammatically
- __complements__: obligatory phrases
- - e.g. transitive verbs take an NP complement

- __constituent__: phrases which make up sentences
- __constituent in a tree__: a set of elements form a constituent in a tree diagram iff there is a single node that dominates just these elements and no other items

## Syntactic tests for constituent structure
- sentence fragment test: we ask a question to which NP answers
- echo question test: we ask a question by replacing the NP with a wh-question (e.g. _you saw -which film-?_)
- cleft construction: bring the NP into focus, fronting
- coordination
