# Heads and constituents
- __head__: most important word in the phrase
- - determines the meaning of the entire phrase
- - it's possible to substitute the whole phrase with the head
- - often require dependents to agree grammatically
- __dependent__:
- - can be complements or modifiers
- - is necessary for a head (requested by the context)
- __predicate__:
- - expresses the event that's occuring in the sentence
- __predicator__:
- - head of the predicate (usually the verb)
- __adjunct__:
- - optional, or structurally dispensable, part of a sentence, clause, or phrase that, if removed or discarded, will not otherwise affect the remainder of the sentence
- __complements__:
- always dependents, depend mostly on the predicate
- obligatory dependent phrases of a particular word class
- - e.g. transitive verbs take an NP complement
- __determiners__:
- always dependents
- __object__:
- - typically a noun phrase that denotes the entity that is acted upon or which is being changed
- __modifiers__:
- optional dependent phrase or word belonging to a particular word class
- either dependents or adjuncts
- __supplements__:
- always adjuncts

- __constituent__: phrases which make up sentences
- __constituent in a tree__: a set of elements form a constituent in a tree diagram iff there is a single node that dominates just these elements and no other items

## Syntactic tests for constituent structure
- sentence fragment test: we ask a question to which NP answers
- echo question test: we ask a question by replacing the NP with a wh-question (e.g. _you saw -which film-?_)
- cleft construction: bring the NP into focus, fronting
- pronoun substitution
- coordination

## Head position in contrast with its dependents
- cross-linguistic phenomenon
- head-initial, head-final 

## Marking
- head marking: grammar markings on the head
- dependent marking: grammar markings on the dependents

# Trees
- __dominance__: a parent dominates a child (not necessarily an immediate one)
