## Entropy reduction
- high reduction
- low reduction
- minimally specified

## Filler Trick
- run two experiments at the same time and they serve as fillers for each other


## Research methods in psycholinguistics
### offline methods
- measure DVs that reflect the outcome of processing, e.g. rating study, questionare
- no direct access to mental process
- reflect conscious decision making
- task is delayed in time (from exposure to stimulus  to measured response)

### online methods
- measure DVs that tap into processing as it happens, e.g. brain activity
- mediated access tomental process
- more automated / less conscious
- task has to be solved with only a short time delay
- e.g. reading times

### true online methods
- immediate access to mental process
- highly automated / unconscious
- task and response are directly linked

### something in between


# Offline methods

- questionnare (rating studies, cloze task - erganzung, comprehension questions - e.g. garden path)
- picture naming

## Grammatical Maze (G-Maze)
- SPRS but make the users choose between two words (one correct, one foil) to limit spill over effects
