experiment notes:

## demographics
- assuming at most 3 foreign language fluencies
- "age when first learned" sounds weird
- asking about basic data (age, gender) after more complex ones (fluency)


## experiment
- telling the participant correct/wrong answers


## goal
- hypothesis that users get better/faster because they can anticipate the task and especially the input sentence structure
- hypothesis that if both color & shape are not at the location given in the sentence, users make less mistakes (or just none of the tree match / the object doesn't exist)
- some patterns in which users press space for next word
