- variables
- - independent: what is manipulated by experimenter
- - dependent: what is measured, response by participant

- predictive context: _the journalist published the.._ [here we assume something that is publishable]
- non-predictive context: _the man evaluated the.._ [here could be anything]


## Factors
- single factor design
- one factor with two or three levels (depth, conditions)
- - 1x2 design
- - 1x3 design

- factorial design, multiple independent IVs factor
- - 2x2 design
- - 2x3 design (two factors, first with depth two, second depth 3)
- - 2x2x2 design
- - 3x2x2x2 design (four factors, first of depth three, ...)


## Subject Design

### Between-Subject
- each participant is tested in only one condition
- advantage:
- - participants are less likely to guess the purpose of the experiment
- disadvantage:
- - large number of participants needed
- - cannot directly compare effects within individuals
- - differences between conditions cuold reflect individual differences between groups (high variance)

### Within-Subject
- advantage:
- - more control on individual differences
- - can directly compare effects within individuals
- - less subjects are needed
- disadvantage:
- - participants are more likely to guess the purpose of the experiment
- - carry-over effects

### Mixed Design
- each participant is tested in some conditions
- usually split by a specific factor

## Carry-Over Effects
- occur when testing under one condition affects how participants behave in another condition
- solution:
- - create counterbalanced lists (latin square, every participant sees every stimulus exactly with one condition)
- - hiding manipulation (add fillers which are not related to the experiment)
- other use of fillers:
- - manually increase the probability of some condition, so that it's perceived as more useful
- - the extra data has to be thrown away, however, so that the classes are balanced


## HW
- method: self-paced reading study, participants viewed sentences with relative clauses that could attach to one of two sites
- independent variables: position where relative clauses attach, types of questions
- dependent variables: reading speed
