Except for EEG there is also MEG

## EEG
- when is something happening, not where

## MEG
- different than EEG
- measures magnetic properties
- right hand rule
- answers better _where_ is something happening (except for orthogonal sources)
- more obstructed workplace

## MRI (fMRI)
- measures blood flow
- obstructs the user more

## PET
- also exits
- won't be in the exam at all
