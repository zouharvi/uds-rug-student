# Online Methods
- when, what, where is something happening

## behavioral methods
- test two candidate hypotheses
- design experiment so that A and B lead to different responses

- stimulus: anything sensory (words, pictures, combination..)
- task: respond to stimuli (name the color of the word, etc..)
- response: bodily change that can be physically measured (pressing a button, eye movement)
- dependent variables:
- - aspect of response that is actually measured
- - (time, focus..)


### what can be inferred
- we need some linking hypothesis between the response and our own hypothesis
- e.g. response time:
- - mental operations take time
- - complexity of a mental proces is reflected in response latency
- - more difficult mental operations take more time


## Tasks
- lexical decision
- priming techniques
- self-paced reading
- eye tracking

### Lexical Decision Task
- stimuli: string of characters flashes on screen
- task: decide whether the string is a word or a non-word
- dependent variables: response time, accuracy
- e.g. is a word in language?

### Priming Technique
- stimuli: prime string and target string
- task: make a lexical decision on the target
- dependent variable: response time, accuracy
- independent variables:
- - relationship betwen prime and target (semantic, phonetic)
- - stimulus onset asynchrony

#### Semantic priming
- SOA - interval betwwen showing of prime and showing of target
- - sum of prime duration and filling betwwen

### Self-Paced Reading
- stimuli: sentences presented word by word or phrase by phrase
- task: participant controls rate of presentation by pressing a button
- dependent variable: time between each button press
- independent variables:
- - entropy reduction
- - syntactic encoding
- - factor complexity

### Eye-Tracking
- provides detailed gaze information
- stimuli: whole sentences, entire texts
- task: just reading
- dependent variables: eye-movement measures
