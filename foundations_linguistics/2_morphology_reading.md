# Chap 2 (Understanding Morphology)
- __word__: used in a text or in speech, general
- __morpheme__: smallest meaningful constituent of a linguistic expression
- __monomorphemic__: single morpheme-word, can't be segmented further
- __lexeme__: abstract word, dictionary word, no phonological form, _>live<_
- __compound lexeme__: firewood
- __word-form__: sequence of sounds that expresses the combination of a lexeme and a set of grammatical meanings or functions, _live, lives, lived, living_
- __paradigm__: set of word-forms that belong to a lexeme, usually they all share some  main morpheme
- __word family__: when lexemes relate together,  _read, readable, unreadable, reader.._
- __inflection__: relationship between word-forms of a lexeme
- __derivation__: relationship between lexemes of a word family
- __derivative__: a derived lexeme
- __affix__: attaches to a word, does not occur by itself, (suffix, prefix, infix, circumfix)
- __base__: also stem, can be complex/composed of multiple morphemes
- __bound stem__: doesn't appear as a word form
- __root__: base which can't be further split
- __allommorph__: when a single affix has multiple "forms", [-s] [-z] [-ez] for plural in English, sleep x slept
- __phonological allomorphs__: allomorphs which are phonologically similar (happens often)
- __alternation__: formal relation between multiple phonological allomorphs

 
We usually assume some base underlying phonological form and then form rules, which produce the allomorphic forms. The underyling phonological forms [ta:g-e] and [ta:g] don't have alomorphic stems, but by applying a rule, the second becomes [ta:k]
 
- __suppletive allomorphs__: alomorphs not similar in pronunciation, (go, wen-t)
- __weak/strong suppletion__: .. because the distinction is not clear, weak: (buy, bough-t), strong: (good, bett-er)
- __conditioning__ of allomorphy: conditions  under which  different allomorphs are selected
- __phonological conditioning__:  phonological motivates the changes
- __morphological conditioning__: morphological context (grammatical function) motivates the changes
- __lexical conditioning__: choice of a suppletive affix allomorph is dependent on other properties of the base, e.g. semantic properties


# Chap 3 (Understanding Morphology)

Sometimes it is not possible to segment what has changed (Mutter -> MÃ¼tter). Therefore we use the term __morphological pattern__ to accomodate both ways in which the changes can occur. In this view, a morpheme is just the most common kind of a morphological pattern.

- __concatenative morphological patterns__: two morphemes ordered one after another (affixation (suffixation, prefixation) and compounding)
- __combinatory potential__: rule which states what morphemes can be combined (e.g. _un-_ doesn't usually combine with nouns, but _non-_ does)
- __non-concatenative morphological patterns__: everything else, we usually assume the __base__ form and then apply rules
- __base/stem modification__: A non-concatenative morphological patter in which the base is changed and no segmentable material is added. Usually difference in pronounciation/stress shift
- __coalescence__: fusion of originally free-standing words, if they are both content words,  then it's a compnound, otherwise non-compound

## Morpheme-based model
- phrase-like rules
- perhaps pure concatenative
- similar to syntax, morphology also has a hiearchical structure
- combinatory potential of morphemes stored in a __lexical entry__
- problems with expressing base modifications

## Word-base model
- word-schema: similar to lexical entries for words/morphpemes, but abstract and use variables, _/Xz/ N_ (plural of a noun X, holds for some X)
- - reduplication: /XC1a/N (noun X) <-> /XC1aC1/N (plurality of X), where C1 is some consonant
- more satisfactory solutions
