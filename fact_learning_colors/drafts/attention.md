# Use the eye tracker to measure attention

I don't know if it is doable, but we might use the eye tracker to measure the attention of the subject. Whenever the subject loses too much attention the program will switch to a different mode to reengage the subject. As this is merely a sensory function of a system this idea has a wide use range and can thus be combined with the main idea we come up with.  
In the context of the [translation idea](https://github.com/zouharvi/user-models/blob/main/drafts/translation.md), we could determine how much attention the subject is giving to the to be translated sentence. Whenever we think the attention is too low, one might switch to another topic of sentences or present the user with sentences to be translated from language B to A instead of A to B.  
Furthermore, the level of attention can be used as a modifier to the results as a subject giving his/her fullest attention might be quicker in translation a certain sentence than a subject giving only half of his/her attention. This modifier can be even further specified by using the level of cognitive load (as has been discussed in class can be determined from the pupil size of the subject).
