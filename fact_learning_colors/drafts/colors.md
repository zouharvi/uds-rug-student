In case of translation, I too am of the opinion that word translation would be the better way to go for the same reasons as stated by @Cynthiasky.

Another idea:
Studying the influence of colours on learning
This could be an addition to the translation task or we could use a completely diffrent task (complex arithmetic operations, country flags etc). 
Setu: A screen with a background colour and the learning target (word/flag)
We track how the user is performing with regard to the task and determine any apparent correlation between the background colours and right/ wrong responses. The background colours are adjusted in future episodes to get maximum productivity.
