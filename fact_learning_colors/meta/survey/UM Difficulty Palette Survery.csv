Tijdstempel,Which of the following palettes do you most associate with levels from easy to difficult?,"Would you prefer another scale, not listed here? If yes, describe it as accurately as possible."
23-9-2021 10:59:06,green-red,"I prefer the green-red scale, but with yellow inbetween (to indicate medium difficulty)"
23-9-2021 10:59:36,green-red,
23-9-2021 11:00:49,green-red,Just numbers from 1 to 10 indicating from easy to difficult 
23-9-2021 11:07:18,blue-red,
23-9-2021 11:09:58,green-red,From green to orange to red
23-9-2021 11:11:03,green-red,I think I would prefer a scale without a white stripe in the middle but with a smooth transition from one color to the other.
23-9-2021 11:14:15,green-red,
23-9-2021 11:17:03,green-red,Cyan to Red would also be appropriate. Cyan is easy on the eyes and has a calming effect while red demands attention and caution.
