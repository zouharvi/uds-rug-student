The assginments are done in Jupyter Notebooks. Running the cells after each other should produce example outputs. The notebooks are also provided as exported PDFs. The outputs are however non-reproducible by seeds (though if you run the code enough times, by the law of large numbers, you will one day get the same output).

I would wish to claim some extra points for doing both the second and the third assignment and also working with reverse n-grams, multiple external datasets, lowercasing (and case restoration) and creating and switching ngram model in the second assignment.

The best result is the last generated snippet from the text generation task:

```
The same way again.
I will go to bed.

Discover the magic of the earth
for some people are still in it.
