# components example minutes

## posters with covid rules
- keep distance 1.5 meters, where it's valid, illustration
- components:
- - provision of information: explanation
- - damage limitation: distancing is imperative

## press conference
- lot of matter of fact information (predominantly provision)
- instructions, e.g. vaccinations encouragement (damage limitation)
- explanation and long term strategy in simple language, emotion control (sense-making)
- Is allowing the public to ask questions at the press conferences better than limiting it to the press?
- - not clear
- difference between the first conferences and the later ones
- - first conferences were focused on providing information and damage limitation and putting things in perspective
- - currently focused more on sense-making and damage limitation because people are tired

## vaccination
- not mandatory -> encouragement
- - not clearly damage limitation (not imperative), a mix of components
- - manipulation?
- anti-vaxxers
- - good: critical thinking
- - bad: spreading of false information
- - caused possibly by confirmation bias (we want to read/listen to what we already believe)
- - not a real discussion, polarization

## misc.
- crisis communication should be citizen-oriented
- sometimes it can be reputation management
- - e.g. response to backlash after measures relaxed and rise in cases
- - outside of the three principles of crisis communication
- - usually blaming someone/something
- - protecting oneself
- risk communication
- - avoiding crisis, preparing for a crisis
- crisis communication
- - resolving the current crisis
- components of crisis communication
- - not a theory but an approach (!)

## theory
- provides explanation, description, prediction
- technically something which can't be disproved
- - issue when it's not defeasible at all (some conspiracy theories)
