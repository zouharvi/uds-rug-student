1. Mark the concepts and terms you donâ€™t understand;
2. Make a note of the theories referred to in the papers; indicate which theories you are familiar with, and which ones you are not familiar with;
3. Mark the sections and paragraphs that address:
   - Channels / media in general;
   - Task - channel fit;
   - Channel choice and behavior;
4. Describe concisely the specific cases referred to in the papers to illustrate the ideas and theories proposed.

# Intro

- "organizational success is based on the ability to process informatoin of appropriate richness to reduce uncertainty and clarify ambiguity"

# Theories
- ???

# Paper

## Channels / media in general
- pages 6-11 (figures 1 and 2)

## Channel choice and behaviour
- figure 3 (page 14)
- pages 16-???
- figure 5

# Concepts

## high-/low-variety languages
- ability to transmit higher-order concepts, such as art or emotions
- complex social phenomena require a high-variety language
- unambiguous and well understood topics use low-variety languages (such as mathematics) to not introduce extra noise

## information richness
- plain data - low richness
- face to face - high richness
- ideal channel choice is diagonal on figure 3 (richness - task complexity)

## knowledge of cause-effect relationships
- also called analyzability
- page 12
- ???

## mode of presentation
- people tend to make decisions based more on examples over statistics

## vertical/horizontal information processing
- vertical - from the external world to the organization?
- - reduce equivocality (multiple interpretations, be consistent), interpretation
- horizontal - in-between departments?
- - coordination

## information tasks
1. reduce equivocality
2. process sufficient amount of information to enable internal coordination and task performance

## vertical (hiearchical) information model
- lower organization levels are more objective oriented and do not have high need to reduce equivocality
- high-level decisions with richness requirements are made fort top-level tasks
- - these can trickle down for less complex tasks 

## horizontal information model
- information processing between departments on the same level, inter-dependence (dependent on each other)
- information needs to flow horizontally

# Examples

## City Government
- tornado crisis with high damage and several deaths
- administration had prepared beforehand for natural crisis
- - organize everything from national guard armory
- - together with medical supplies
- issue: armory got destroyed by the tornado, highly equivocal situation
- solution: ad hoc regroup at a new place and organize help from there, very rich media
- high uncertainty, low equivocality (good organization & understanding)

## Business College
- issue with comparing information from different sources (recommendation reports)
- lengthy discussion had better results
- different frames of reference, rich media required to establish a common perspective
- originally low uncertainty, high equivocality

## Fashion Retail Chain
- first executive was trying to keep in touch with the industry, the stores and the plants
- the new executive relied more on formal reports and detailed analysis
- the latter was removed after disapproval from the board of directors
- rich media needed
- (low uncertainty, high equivocality but high to interpret this way)
