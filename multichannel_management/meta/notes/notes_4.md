# Theories of Channel Choice

## Misc. issues
- attribution theory
- - explaining behaviour
- - external: the cause of your behaviour is external (preferred when negative)
- - internal: the cause is within (preferred when positive)
- social information processing theory
- - we take social cues into account when deciding what to do
- - e.g. someone looking puzzled -> more explanation
- SIM being neither idiosyncratic nor random (???)
- conflict resolution and negotiation by email explained by SIM (???)
- horizontal and vertical views on politics (???)

## Comparison
- IRT rather prescriptive
- SIM descriptive, explains stuff IRT can't

## Categorization
- Daft & Wiginton (1979)
- - high and low variety languages (differencce in languages in how well they convey information)
- - bounded rationality
- Walther (2011)
- alternative theories or extensions of IRT/MRT (media richness theory)

## Pieterson (2009)
- compensation effects in less rich channels
- - e.g. explaining all necessary stuff in an email instead of wating for a question as in a conversation


## Computer Mediated Communication
- common concerns: how do digital communication cues affect the interaction?


TODO:
- search for more recent theories of channel choice base on ideas of MRT or SIM
- choose one of these theories, read about it and make a summary of its main ideas
- due wednesday
- assignment in slides
