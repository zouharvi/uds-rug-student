1. Mark the concepts and terms you donâ€™t understand;
2. Make a note of the theories referred to in the papers; indicate which theories you are familiar with, and which ones you are not familiar with;
3. Mark the sections and paragraphs that address:
   - Channels / media in general;
   - Task - channel fit;
   - Channel choice and behavior;
4. Describe concisely the specific cases referred to in the papers to illustrate the ideas and theories proposed.

# Introduction
- modeling media-use behaviour
- function of accessibility, experience, cost, time, communicatoin requirements

# Concepts
- retrospective rationality (rationalize previous behaviour)

## Theories
- symbolic interactionism (?)
- social learning theory (learn from others)
- social information processing (?)
- attribution theory (?)

## Rational Choice Models of Media Use
- matching based on given requirements
- "the medium has neither more or less communication capability that match the requirements"
- if match is perfect, becomes efficient example
- social presence theory
- - degree to which the medium facilitates awareness of the other person and interpersonal relationships during the 
interaction
- - face-to-face highest, print lowest
- - Q: does this ordering follow richness? (yes but they don't try to explain it this way)
- information richness theory
- - based on speed of feedback, types of channels, personalness of source, richness of language
- ambiguous task require rich media, unambiguous tasks require lean media
- assumptions:
- - media have fixed properties and richness is invariant of who uses it
- - individuals make independent choices
- - choice making is a cognitive process and objectively rational
- - behaviour is efficiency-motivated
- prediction:
- - groups for similar tasks have similar usage patterns

## Social Influence Model of Media Use
- media perception is not fixed across individuals
- multiple individual factors in the group influence individual decisions (examples from history, recommendations)
- effective behaviour through observation learning
- examples:
- - statements by coworkers
- - vicarious (indirect) learning
- - group norms
- - personal attitudes
- much more dynamic system (individuals observe their own histories and develop explanation)
- possible issue: "don't fix what ain't broken" prevents the change of channels
- prediction:
- - groups even across tasks have similar usage patterns

## Misc.
- prediction:
- - leaner media used less frequently in higher-order management

# Examples

## Petrochemical R&D
- "manager reported to a division manager that rapid information exchange with field sites via email helped to speed up the product development cycle"
- highlights (individual!):
- - speed of feedback
- - ability to rapidly convey a message to a remote site
- - results in reducing product development cycle

## Electric Equipment Manufacturer
- engineer needed to last-minute inform someone
- another engineer suggested that a written memo would be problematic and that personal visit would be better
- more recommendations by other engineers

## Advertising Company
- major client lost because of a misinterpretation of an email
- consequence is that telephone was then used more often
- - opposite could have occured as well though -> not based on rationality

## Aerospace Firm
- tried videoconferencing
- key engineer refused to use the system
- widespread perception of a secruity flaw (not really present) caused the disuse

## Petrochemical Firm
- tried videoconferencing
- roll-out first with users who had the needs and positive attitude towards it
- better results because these people become opinion leaders and share the positive attitude
