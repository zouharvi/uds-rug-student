- provision
- - what happened
- - why is this a crisis
- damage limitation
- - what to do
- sense making
- - a lot of about emotions
- - understanding of the rationale
- - what will happen in the future
- - makes the people feel more secure


If we took out:
- provision:
- - people would not understand what is going on
- damage limitation:
- - no actionable advice would be given
- sense making:
- - people could be unsure about the leadership and could become frustrated
- - happened in Czechia, rules were confusing
