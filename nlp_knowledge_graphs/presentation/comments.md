Overview over Language Models, what they do and how they contribute to NLP
(a slide or two)
- others don't do LM
- what advantages over other techniques

Summary slide (or two) at the end
- also with my comments

next word completion/prediction (choose prediciton consistently)

API style references (not bibtex)

Number references in the presentation (the not main paper)

Keep text and equantions together (because they're not easy to follow)

Page 6 (more complex natural language query)

Notation of variables

Redraw tables

Re-frame the questions to the tutor (not the local graph building though)

Relation is added when the relation word is added (together with the child)


Term paper:
- Comparison (3rd discussion point) seems the easiest
- Others are good as well
